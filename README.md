# Gabriel's WoW Companion App

Welcome to Gabriel's WoW Companion App, an application crafted with the aim of honing my UI design skills and mastering the MVVM architecture in .NET MAUI. 
Please Note: This application was created to practice the MVVM architecture and Android phone application developement. There will be no furhter public updates on the application.

## Features

### Log Interface with Warcraft Logs API Integration
My WoW Companion App seamlessly integrates with the Warcraft Logs API to provide a powerful log interface. The application allows you to explore and analyze combat logs, specifically optimized for the Ulduar raid. Allowing me to track my performance with ease.

I have created a fully functional talent calculator within the application. Here I can easily experiment with different talent combinations and build strategies for each of the three priest specilizations.
